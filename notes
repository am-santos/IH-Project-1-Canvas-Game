BULK IDEAS:
- Add bomb image and rotate it
- Make char move through the ground
- bombs change the ground
- boundaries for characters to move
- make no boundaries for gun shoots
- each player have a team of chars
- several different guns:
    - cannon gun
    - machine gun
    - starts slow and multiplies in several shoots
    - sticky gun (CRAZY)
- points system questions:
    - how much each shoot?
    - how to deal with area damage.
    - total life of char?
    - display total points and each chra # of points?
- Effects to Shoots:
    - sound
    - image

CRAZY STUFF
- Scale effects on gun fires (change zoom to follow the shoot and show the explosion)
- Scale everything, see the shoot from long distance and then zoom when getting closer to target.





NOTES:
- Check video for effects ( IMPORTANT!! )
- Use js files for images and audio?
