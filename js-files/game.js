/* 
  Game Ideas:

  Each team will make one shoot at a time
      - if more than one character per team, make them shoot one at a time.
  Team that reaches zero health first will loose

  User interactions per turn,
    - move worm -> set coordinates
    - sets direction -> left/right values
    - set shooting position -> up/down arrows
    - shoot
    
  Game calculations after user shoots gun,
    - set shoot trajectory
    - check shoot collision on each movement, until it is out of the canvas or collides with ground or any char
    - make shoot explode
    - calculate life for each char
    - update each char life
    - remove dead char
    - update board scores
    - check if any team has zero char left
    - assign winning team
